FemtoRV32 Design: from zero to I,II,III,IV ... RISC-V
=====================================================

_During the first confinement in March 2020, I grabbed an IceStick
just before getting stuck at home, with the idea in mind to learn
verilog and processor design. FemtoRV32 is a super-simple design,
it is too basic (no pipeline), but it may be useful to somebody who
wants to quickly understand the general principles._

To understand processor design, the first thing that I have read was
[this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51592244/implementation-of-simple-microprocessor-using-verilog/51621153#51621153)
on Stackoverflow. There are too nice things with this answer:
- it does to the essential, and keeps nothing else than what's essential
- the taken example is a RISC processor, that shares several similarities with RISC-V
