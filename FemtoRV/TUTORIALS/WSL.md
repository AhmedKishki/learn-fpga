Windows/WSL Tutorial (WIP)
==========================

My tutorials are mainly adapted to Linux users (I'm using Ubuntu). It 
is possible to make everything work under Windows using WSL,
@gojimmypi reported a success and explains how to do that
[here](https://gojimmypi.blogspot.com/2020/12/ice40-fpga-programming-with-wsl-and.html).
Synthetising the core, compiling RISC-V code and flashing the device
work. Talking to the device through a terminal emulator doesn't.
The solution may be[here](https://github.com/rpasek/usbip-wsl2-instructions).
